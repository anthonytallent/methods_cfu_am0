# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
<br> Pretty good after all the practice and the ability to google/ruby-docs what I don't know
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
<br> I feel relatively good about it. This didn't take me that long to comprehend.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
<br> How big of a code can you write for a method/is there a limit?
